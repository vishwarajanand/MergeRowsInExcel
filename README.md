# MergeRowsInExcel
Merging few rows to a single column is not directly available in excel currently. I made a macro which provides that functionality.

# Files

1. `Merge Rows in Excel.mov` - [video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishwarajanand/MergeRowsInExcel/master/Merge_Rows_in_Excel.mov) which explains how this feature works

2. `MergeRowsExcelSnap.png` - Snapshot to show how the sheet looks like

3. `MergeRows.vba` - the script which can be used to recreate the magic

4. `MergeRowsToNewColumns.xlsm` - Just copy paste the sheet, enable macro and see how rows can be merged
