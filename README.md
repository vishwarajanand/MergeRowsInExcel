# MergeRowsInExcel
Merging few rows to a single column is not directly available in excel currently. I made a macro which provides that functionality.

# Files

1. Merge Rows in Excel.mov which explains how this feature works

2. MergeRowsExcelSnap.png which shows how the shet looks like.

3. MergeRows.vba - the script which can be used to recreate the magic

4. MergeRowsToNewColumns.xlsm - Just copy paste the sheet, enable macro and see how rows can be merged.
